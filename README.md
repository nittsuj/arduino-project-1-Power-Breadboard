first arduino project 

## about
This is just a basic turning on the led with your powersupply, utilizing with of course your breadboard and arduino.

note: The DC Jack was a bit rare to find (that already connects with the wire and battery input). Luckily, my local electronic shop did a fix, with making it connect (onsight), and the elderly gentlement used a screwdriver (so, without using soldering iron).
